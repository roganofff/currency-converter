# Android Currency Converter
**Application for converting different currencies** based on **Kotlin** and public **[Exchange-Rate API](https://www.exchangerate-api.com/)** for exchange requests.
### The following technology and library stack was used for the development of application:
  - Retrofit
  - Koin
  - Coroutines
  - WorldCountryData
  - GSON

During development I stuck to the **Clean Architecture**, divided application into three modules: app, data and domain and used the **MVVM pattern**
### To run the project:
  1. Clone the repository on your PC
      ```Bash
     git clone https://github.com/roganofff/currency-converter.git
      ```
  2. Open Android Studio and build the project
  3. Run the application
